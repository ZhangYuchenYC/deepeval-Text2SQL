I booked a house in Santa Teresa for my family for 6 people. When we arrived, there were only 4 people in the house. When we asked the host, he told us that he had changed the booking to a 4 person house and that was the reason we had the smaller room. He then tried to charge us for an additional person and the additional night. When we refused to pay, he offered to split the payment in half and finally agreed to refund us only 70% of the total payment. I strongly suggest everyone to be very careful when booking on airbnb."}
