For example, if a table contains an ID, that can be used as a foreign key in another table. For example, a table product has a product_id column that is a foreign key in the orders table. If we want to add a new product, we must first look at the orders table to see if a product with this id already exists. If it does, we can not add it. So we always need to check the foreign key when adding a new product.\nSo it is a good habit to use foreign key.
