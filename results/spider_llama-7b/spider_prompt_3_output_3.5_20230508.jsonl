This is based on a simple data model that can be adapted to your needs.\n\nThe basic idea is to define a set of roles, and associated permissions.  Then users can be assigned roles, and the set of permissions can be defined for each role.  When you want to know which roles the user has, and which permissions they have, you check the user's role.\n\n\\begin{code}\nCREATE TABLE roles\n(\n    role_id int AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name varchar(255),\n    PRIMARY KEY(role_id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE permissions\n(\n    permission_id int AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    role_id int,\n    permission_name varchar(255),\n    PRIMARY KEY(permission_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY(role_id) REFERENCES roles(role_id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE users\n(\n    user_id int AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name varchar(25"}
