The basic topic of this subject revolves around variables, equations, equations of linear and exponential. Another topic is permutations and combinations of objects which can be integers, real numbers, and letters. The amount of permutations possible is big and the way you apply your knowledge on this is through practice. In high school most students take an easier path in math and just study addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, however, practice these concepts on your own and it will become natural for you and will feel more secure."}
