The query then joins the `players` table to the `matches` table again, this time on the `winner_id` column. This will create a new table that contains all of the information from both tables, for all matches where the player won the Australian Open. The query then filters the results to only include matches that were played in 2022, 2023, or 2024, on a hard court, and at a Grand Slam level. The query then groups the results by the `first_name` and `country_code` columns, and counts the number of rows in each group. The query then selects the `first_name` and `country_code` columns for all groups where the count is equal to 2. This will return a list of all players who won both the WTA Championships and the Australian Open in 2022, 2023, or 2024.\"]}]}"}
