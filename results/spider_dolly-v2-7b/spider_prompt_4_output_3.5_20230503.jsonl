To find the architect who built most mills, we can use join subquery on architect table with mill table and then group by architect_id to find the id, name and nationality of the architect. Finally, to find the airlines that have flights arriving at airport 'AHD', we can use join subquery on airlines table with flights table and then group by Airlines.uid to find the uid."}

You may find it useful to organize your tables by the concepts they illustrate, instead of their actual names: Students, Courses, Departments, etc.\n2. When naming your tables, it is often useful to separate the type of table from the rest of the column names using underscores: Addresses_line_1, Addresses_line_2, etc.\n3. Instead of joining two tables together to get the full set of data you want, it is often more efficient to do a separate query for each table and then combine the results in your application.

It is often used in reference to poker tournaments when the winner takes a substantial monetary prize, especially when the prize money is a large multiple of the player's pre-tournament earnings.\n\nThe term does not refer to the number of players remaining after the tournament, but rather the total number of players who have participated in the tournament. This can include players who chose to leave the tournament before completion (termed \"out of the money\"), players who voluntarily reduce their stake in the tournament (called \"folding\") and players who are eliminated after becoming adjudged \"out of the tournament\", in which case they are also considered to have made a \"final table\" but have not won any money."}

The only tricky part is to determine the capacity of each cinema. Capacities could be computed by dividing the total screening hours by the number of screens.\nFor question #4, it's also relatively easy. I can use language column to find the language of each record and then join country language to find the number of countries a record is spoken in.\nI have some idea about how to answer these questions but I'm not sure if they are correct.
