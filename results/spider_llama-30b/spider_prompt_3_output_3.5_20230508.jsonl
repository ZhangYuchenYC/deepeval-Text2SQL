I believe the only way to do that is with an outer join.\n\nComment: Please edit your question and add sample data and expected result.\n\nComment: @Vladimir: what do you mean by \"all the players who were in a match\"? I can't think of any player who wasn't in a match.\n\nComment: @Barmar - I mean the players who participated in a match but not necessarily the winner or loser.\n\nAnswer: There are actually 2 players in every match. You want the players who didn't win or lose, i.e. who aren't the `loser` or `winner`.\n"}
